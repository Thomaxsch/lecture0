			<h2> Details </h2> 
			 
			<p>  Abbie was the result of a brief relationship between Edwina and Abe during
			the Second World War. Abe was in England before D-Day and had one night of 
			passion with Edwina before he had to leave England. Unknown to Abe, Edwina 
			became pregnant and the result was Abbie. Abe and the rest of the Simpson family first met 
			Abbie when she was 58 years old.</p>
